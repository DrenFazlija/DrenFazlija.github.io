excerpt: 'Causal reasoning has garnered much attention in the AI research community, resulting in an influx of causality-based AI methods in recent years. We believe that this sudden rise of Causal AI has led to many publications that primarily evaluate their proposed algorithms in specifically designed experimental setups. Hence, comparisons between different causal methods, as well as existing state-of-the-art non-causal approaches, become increasingly more difficult. To make Causal AI more accessible and to facilitate comparisons to non-causal methods, we analyze the use of real-world datasets and existing causal inference tools within relevant publications. Furthermore, we support our hypothesis by outlining well-established tools for benchmarking different trustworthy aspects of AI models (interpretability, fairness, robustness, privacy, and safety) healthcare tools and how these systems are not prevalent in respective Causal AI publications.'
