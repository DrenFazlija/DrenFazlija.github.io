excerpt: 'In the image domain, adversarial examples represent maliciously perturbed images that look benign to humans but greatly mislead state-of-the-art ML models. Previously, researchers ensured the imperceptibility of their altered data points by restricting perturbations via ℓp norms. However, recent publications claim that creating natural-looking adversarial examples without such restrictions is also possible. With much more freedom to instill malicious information into data, these unrestricted adversarial examples allow attackers to operate outside the expected threat models. However, surveying existing image-based methods, we noticed a lack of human evaluations of the proposed image modifications. To analyze the imperceptibility of these attacks, we propose SCOOTER – an evaluation framework for unrestricted image-based attacks containing guidelines, standardized questions, and a ready-to-use web app for annotating unrestricted adversarial images.​'
