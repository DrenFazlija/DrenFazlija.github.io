My colleague, Monty-Maximilian Zühlke, and I gave an interactive talk to a 9th-grade class about the impact of AI on the education system. We outlined some basic concepts behind LLMs and showcased examples in which ChatGPT performs well and some in which it performs surprisingly poorly. We discussed these examples with the students and examined the effects of working with AI systems.
