This is a talk I gave as part of our ongoing work on ***SCOOTER*** â€“ a human assessment framework for unrestricted adversarial examples. This was a great opportunity to get high-quality feedback and talk and connect with great researchers. Shoutout to Rohan Chitnis, who helped me find a print shop near Stanford that provides same-day poster printing! (I lost the original poster on the way to my hotel... ðŸ˜…).
