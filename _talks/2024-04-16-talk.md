Monty-Maximilian ZÃ¼hlke and I gave an interactive talk to all three 10th-grade classes of the [Gymnasium am Markt (or simply GamMa) in Achim, Lower Saxony](https://gamma-achim.de/homepage/) about the impact of AI on the education system. To keep the students engaged for 90 minutes, we also asked them to create exams with ChatGPT and other systems. Overall, it was interesting to see the differences between the three classes and how modern a German school can be (all students had their own iPad, with which they could share their content live on a digital board at the front of the room). <span>&#8594;</span> [More information here](https://gamma-achim.de/homepage/ki-workshop-2024.html)
