Monty-Maximilian Zühlke and I engaged in a dialogue about AI's impact on everyday life, a topic we've previously explored in workshops for school students. However, this workshop was a special opportunity as it allowed us to delve into the intersection of religion and AI, a topic that resonates with a diverse background of evangelic non-experts. As part of the 6th Ecumenical Trinity Reception in St. Nicolai in Hannover, we presented the impact and potential of modern AI technologies to this diverse audience. The discussions that followed were unique and insightful, and we are committed to expanding this workshop series to reach out to various audience demographics.
