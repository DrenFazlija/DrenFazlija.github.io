Together with Dr. Daniel Kudenko and Michael Hobusch, Monty-Maximilian Zühlke and I had the opportunity to present the impact of modern AI to vocational school students of the BBS Burgdorf. In our section of the workshop, Monty-Maximilian and I presented the strengths and weaknesses of modern LLM services like ChatGPT and Perplexity AI.
